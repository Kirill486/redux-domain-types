# Redux Domain types

Now we have the ```api_description``` folder.

We makeing up more and more common scenarios to act like we have easiest possible model implementation.

Get me right here!!! 
The ```redux-domain-types``` is the model implementation. You ***must not*** write buisiness-logic here.
It's just a fancy in-memory data storage with synckrosyty, time travel and blackjack))) To help all humans)

For buisiness-logic layer inplementation I would recommend ```redux-saga```. It does the job well.
Even too well. You can literally **translaate** well-written buisiness requiriments into code.
It has great documentation, so check it out, it's really excyting reading)
