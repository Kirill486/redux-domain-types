# Redux Domain types

## Plan

1. API description
2. Tests
3. Green tests
4. Documentation
5. More tests

## API description.

- we provide entity of a domain type
- we get reducer and crud action creators

## Pre

We write a regular reducer that provide the discribed API to have both code tested at once.

# Yo-ho-ho

So we have different levels of *something*

I.  store responds to the set_state and reset_state action (whole state *something*)
II. store responds to the set_entity and reset_entity action (entity level *something*)
III. CRUD entity
IV. indexes of 2 kinds model(like by name, date of birth), buisiness logic (like selected, marked to delet, current) HashMap in the bottom.
