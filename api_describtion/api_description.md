# API Description.

Here're we at the place of silliness. API is created here.
This part is written before the single line of implementation.

Here we ```describe``` ideal world)), but the actual tests that can be run are in the ```/tests``` folder.
We should keep this ***api_description*** relatively short to provide a landing place to understand what is this thing the library **provides**.
